Description
===========

A complete enumeration of all linear approximations of the S-box is given in the *Linear Profile* (In the literature, an equivalent matrix called Linear Approximation Table is used as well), which is a matrix whose rows are indexed by :math:`\vec{u} \in \gf{V_n}` and whose columns are indexed by :math:`\vec{v} \in \gf{V_m}` in lexicographic order, denoted by :math:`\matr{LP}(F) \in \matr{M}_{2^n \times 2^m}(\bbbr)`. It holds that :math:`\matr{LP}(F)(\vec{u},\vec{v}) =|\matr{WS}(F)(\vec{u},\vec{v})|^2`. The lower bound of the Linear Profile values is *0* and the upper bound is :math:`2^{2n}`.

If we divide each element in the Linear Profile by the value on :math:`\matr{LP}(F)(\vec{0},\vec{0})`, these values represent the number of matches between the linear equation represented in hexadecimal as "Input Sum" and the sum of the output bits represented in hexadecimal as "Output Sum". Hence, subtracting to these values :math:`\frac{1}{2}` give the probability bias for the particular linear combination of input and output bits. The hexadecimal value representing a sum, when viewed as a binary value indicates the variables involved in the sum. For a linear combination of input variables represented as :math:`u_1 \cdot x_1+ \cdots +u_n \cdot x_n` where :math:`u_i \in \gf{GF(2)}`, the hexadecimal value represents the binary value :math:`u_1 \ldots u_n`, where :math:`u_1` is the most significant bit. Similarly, for a linear combination of output bits :math:`v_1 \cdot y_1+ \cdots +v_m \cdot y_m` where :math:`v_i \in \gf{GF(2)}`, the hexadecimal value represents the binary vector :math:`(v_1, \ldots ,v_m)`. 

In Linear Profiles, we are looking for entries with large value. If all of the entries are small, then the S-box does not have a very linear structure, and it may make Linear Cryptanalysis on the cipher difficult. The *Linear potential* of *F*, defined as :math:`\crit{lp}(F) = \frac{1}{2^{2n}} \cdot \stackrel{*}{\max} \left( {\matr{WS}(F)(\vec{u},\vec{v})}^2 \right)` is a measure of linearity in Linear Cryptanalysis, and satisfies :math:`2^{-n} \leq \crit{lp}(F) \leq 1` so that the lower bound holds if and only if *F* has maximum nonlinearity (*F* is bent) and the upper bound is reached when *F* is linear or affine. This criterion can take values from :math:`\frac{1}{2^n}` to 1. The larger :math:`\crit{lp}(F)` is, the "closer" to a Linear Vector Boolean function is *F*. 

Library
=======

Note that the Linear Profile does not uniquely determine a Vector Boolean function. Thus, a VBF class cannot be initialized by its Linear Profile. To obtain its representation as Linear Profile, the following method must be used:

.. code-block:: c

	void LAT(NTL::mat_ZZ& LP, VBF& F)

In the VBF library, several methods have been defined in order to analyse the feasibility of Linear Cryptanalysis: Linear potential and Linear relations associated with a specific value of the Linear Profile. The method used to obtain the linear potential is the following:

.. code-block:: c

	void lp(NTL::RR& x, VBF& F)

If we want to obtain the linear expressions associated with the value of the Linear Profile "w", we will use this method:

.. code-block:: c

	void linear(NTL_SNS ostream& s, VBF& a, ZZ& w)

If we want to obtain the probability bias :math:`|p_L-\frac{1}{2}|` that a linear expression holds with the value of the Linear Profile "w", we will use this method:

.. code-block:: c

	void ProbLin(NTL::RR& x, VBF& a, NTL::ZZ& w)

Example
-------

The following program finds out the Linear Profile of a Vector Boolean function together with the linear expressions that have the highest value, except from the value in :math:`\matr{LP}(F)(\vec{0},\vec{0})`, their probability, this highest value and the linear potential.

.. code-block:: c

  #include <iostream>
  #include <fstream>
  #include "VBF.h"

  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    using namespace VBFNS;

    VBF     F;
    NTL::mat_GF2 T;
    NTL::ZZ   w;
    NTL::RR   bias;

    ifstream input(argv[1]);
    if(!input) {
     cerr << "Error opening " << argv[1] << endl;
     return 0;
    }
    input >> T;
    F.puttt(T);
    input.close();

    cout << "The Linear Profile is:" << endl;
    cout << LAT(F) << endl;

    w = maxLAT(F);
    cout << endl << "The highest value of the Linear Profile is= " 
    << w << endl << endl;

    cout << "The linear expressions that have the highest value are:" 
    << endl;
    linear(cout,F,w);

    ProbLin(bias,F,w);
    cout << endl;
    cout << "These expressions hold with probability bias= " 
    << bias << endl;

    cout << endl << "The linear potential is= " << lp(F) << endl;

    return 0;
  }

If we use as input of this program the Truth Table of *NibbleSub*, the output of the program would be the following:
