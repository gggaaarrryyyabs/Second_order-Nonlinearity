Book Writing Methodology
************************

The GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/) were used for writing this
book. GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The html pages were built with Sphinx using a theme provided by Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org/). Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license. The Read the Docs theme features beautiful typography and a nice blue color scheme. It looks great on mobile, and provides a menu of all the pages on the left-hand side.
