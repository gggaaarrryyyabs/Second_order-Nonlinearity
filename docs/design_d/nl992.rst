3316 different profiles were found with nonlinearity 992. The algebraic degree takes values from the set { 9, 10 }. The algebraic immunity takes values from the set { 4, 5 }. The absolute indicator takes values from the set: { 120, 128, 136, 144, 160, 168, 176, 192, 200, 208, 224, 232, 240, 248, 256, 264 }. The sum-of-square indicator takes 682 different values between 5244800 and 5844608.
