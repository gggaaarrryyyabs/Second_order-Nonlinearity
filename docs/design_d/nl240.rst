9-variable Balanced Boolean functions with nonlinearity 240
***********************************************************

Below you can find the profiles of 9-variable balanced functions with the the best known nonlinearity (240). Each row represents a profile with four values separated by commmas: Algebraic Degree, Algebraic Immunity, Absolute Indicator and Sum-of-square Indicator:

567 different profiles were found with nonlinearity 240 and algebraic degree 8. The algebraic immunity takes values from the set {4, 5}.The linearity distance takes values from the set {110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 }. The absolute indicator takes values from the set { 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 }. The sum-of-square indicator takes 137 different values between 323456 and 377600.
