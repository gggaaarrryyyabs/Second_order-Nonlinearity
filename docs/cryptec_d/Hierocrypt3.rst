Description
===========

*Hierocrypt3* and Hierocrypt-L1 are block ciphers created by Toshiba in 2000. They were submitted to the NESSIE project, but were not selected. Both algorithms were among the cryptographic techniques recommended for Japanese government use by CRYPTREC in 2003, however, both have been dropped to "candidate" by CRYPTREC revision in 2013. Both of them have the same 8x8 S-box: S
