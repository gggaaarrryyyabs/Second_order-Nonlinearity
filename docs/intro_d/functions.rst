The library covers a wide range of topics for analyzing cryptographic properties
of Vector Boolean Functions. Methods are available for the following areas:

1. Vector Boolean Function representations and characterizations
2. Cryptographic criteria calculation
3. Constructions and operations over Vector Boolean functions

The use of these methods is described in this manual. Each chapter provides detailed definitions of the methods, followed by example programs.
