The VBF library can be easily installed in a matter of minutes on just about
any platform, including virtually any 32- or 64-bit machine running any flavor
of Unix, as well as PCs running Windows, and Macintoshes. VBF achieves this
portability by avoiding esoteric C++ features, and by avoiding assembly code;
it should therefore remain usable for years to come with little or no
maintenance, even as processors and operating systems continue to change and
evolve.
